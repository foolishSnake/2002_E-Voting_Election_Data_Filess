Irelands 2002 e-voting trail election data files
There are 3 .txt files from the trail.
There are 3 .json files that have a list of the candidates and their parties and index. Votes in the JSON are in an array. Each indivual ballot has the value of the preferance for each candidate. The value at the candidates index is their preferance.
There are 3 .json where the order of the ballets where randomly shuffled. These .json when counted have a different final count than the oringal ballot did. Showing that there is some randomness in election results using PSSTV.
